# Welcome to blocitoff!
blocitoff is a simple to-do list app that I created using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript while completing the Web Developer Track at bloc.io. You can sign up, sign in & sign out; add items & check them off (remove them); and see your current list. Adding & marking items complete happens via asynchronous request so you can stay on the list page at all times without refreshing. Bootstrap was used for the styling, Devise for user functionality, and Faker for the pre-seeded data.

## To Use The App
- Go to https://ag17-blocitoff.herokuapp.com/
- Sign in using the email admin@test.test & password wsxedc
- Have fun & poke around!
